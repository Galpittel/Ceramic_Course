                <p>Looking for a unique and engaging activity that brings the beauty of nature into your home and allows you to explore the art of ceramics? Look no further than my studio! Join me for a special one-time workshop where you'll create a stunning ceramic plate adorned with real plants and flowers.</p>
                <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
                <p>This workshop is perfect for groups of friends, bachelorette parties, family birthdays, mitzvah celebrations, and more - no prior experience necessary! Held in a small group setting at my studio in Moshav Kfar Neter (just next to IKEA Netanya), the Garden in a Plate workshop is a 3-hour session where you'll create a one-of-a-kind plate design using fresh plants and flowers, then paint it with your choice of colors from our wide selection.</p>
                <p>Once complete, the plates will dry and be fired in our ceramic oven, ready for collection 1-2 weeks later. The cost per participant is based on groups of 4-8 participants.</p>

                Working with this remarkable material is not just an ordinary task; it is a calming and peaceful experience. We will use our hands to mold and shape the clay, select our favorite flowers, and place them on the surface in a way that aligns with our imagination. The intricate process of lining and painting requires focus, allowing all other thoughts to fade away and bringing our attention to the present moment.
                It's like mindfulness and meditation, providing us with a moment to escape from the chaos of the world and indulge in the creative process. Through the touch of the clay and the vibrant colors of the flowers, we can connect with our inner selves, promoting a sense of calm and serenity.

                        <h3>Hi there, I'm Orly!</h3>
                        <p>I'm Orly Pittel, a designer specializing in personalized ceramic gifts and hosting workshops. Growing up in a creative household, where artistic expression was a part of our everyday lives, I developed a deep love for handicrafts. The influence of art, creation, and my profound appreciation for nature and flowers during my childhood has greatly shaped the person I am today.</p>
                        <p>Fifteen years ago, I stumbled upon a ceramics class that sparked a profound passion within me. Since then, ceramics has become my world, and I am completely immersed in the joy and creativity it brings. There's something incredibly fun, exciting, and addictive about taking a formless lump of clay and transforming it into a vibrant, colorful item that brings smiles to people's faces. Working with clay feels like a collaboration, and I often find myself spending hours in the studio, completely engrossed in the process. </p>
                        <p>One workshop that perfectly combines my loves is the 'garden on a plate.' Inspired by my deep connection to nature and my fascination with the beauty of flowers, I created this workshop. Nature, with its boundless beauty, serves as my greatest inspiration, and I find immense pleasure in incorporating the diverse designs of flowers and plants into my ceramic art. Join me in the 'Garden on a Plate' ceramics workshop, where you can experience the addictive nature of working with clay, the tranquility of nature, and the joy of creating something truly unique.</p>
